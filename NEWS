Changelog for s6-linux-utils.

In 2.4.0.0
----------

 - s6-uevent-listener now writes events to stdout instead of spawning
a program itself. s6-uevent-spawner now reads on stdin. Instead of
running "s6-uevent-listener s6-uevent-spawner mdev", people now run
"s6-uevent-listener | s6-uevent-spawner mdev".
 - s6-devd hides the details.


In 2.3.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Major types overhaul to make them more POSIXly correct:
compatibility with skalibs-2.5.0.0.
